<p>
This is a python app that gives you a math question for you to answer. You can choose the type of problem - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponents. If your answer is incorrect, the correct answer will be shown.
This is currently still in development, bugfixes are being developed.
The code can be downloaded <a href="mathpy.zip">here</a> and run with a Python interpreter. ( The version here is currently out of date. It will be updated soon. )

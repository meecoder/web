mathpy app
</h1>
<p>
This is a python app that gives you a math question for you to answer. You can choose the type of problem - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponents. If your answer is incorrect, the correct answer will be shown.
This is currently still in development - we are adding multiple problems at a time, percent accuracy, and a correct and incorrect count at the end.
The code can be downloaded <a href="mathpy.zip">here</a> and run with a Python 3 interpreter.

and three white doves in this story.

"Aah! I'm a huge animal!", says Mammy the mammoth.
"I'm going to get you!", said Sabry the sabertoothed tiger.
Polie the polar bear just sat there and watched.

Look! Mammy had a baby! It's so cute!
Sabry is keeping an eye on them. Polie left because he
 thought he was allergic to babies.

Look! Polie came back! Yay!! Two babies are playing together, 
but Polie is staying far away from them. Look! There's Sabry! AAH!!
<img src="Images/winter4.jpg"></img>
Whoopsie! Polie had 2 babies! AAH!! He started to run. 
Oh no! Sabry is chasing the mammoths! "Help!", said the baby!

At least they got away from Sabry. Finally they are safe!
It is nighttime, so they shuld watch out.
<img src="Images/winter6.jpg"></img>
Aah! Sabry is back! The playing babies need to watch out!
<img src="Images/winter7.jpg"></img>
Look! Polie and three of her friends' babies are here! Oh no! Sabry 
bit the baby mammoth!
<img src="Images/winter8.jpg"></img>
Oh! I never knew Polie had twins! One of the friend's babies is 
still there, too.

Polie is ready to hibernate, so he ate a lot and got way bigger. 
And yay, the mammoths are getting away! But it's not over yet.

The end.

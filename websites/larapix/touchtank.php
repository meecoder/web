Touchtank, made 11/2/2013
</h3>
<p>
You see the stingrays? You can pet them because it's a touch tank.
The seal is shy because he is new. And the corner has a camoflauged 
octopus. And the spiky thongs are sea urchins having a playdate. And
 look at the colorful fish at the top and the turtles! - 
Lara

Cave, made 11/9/2013
</h3>
<p>
I put a dangling spider from three of the icicles, and a skull from a dead pirate, and some leaves that a tree dropped that a mouse is living in, and a little bat made a house in one of the tunnels in the cave, and a family of three spiders climbed around on a little web. -

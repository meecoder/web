Babies are evil and are going to take over the world. They are super smart and live in a secret land when their parents are not there.
They have many weapons and plan to rule the world. The mission of Attack on Baby is to stop this. To join Attack on Baby you must be 10 or older, 
and prove that you are not a baby. Thank you for your interest.

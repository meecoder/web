<h2>
Class Derpartment of Transportation
</h2>
<h3>
CDOT regulates traffic and vehicles worldwide.
</h3>
<p>
CDOT runs traffic enforcement programs such as red-light cameras, traffic lights, speed limit enforcement, and a system for inspections. They also regulate vehicle requirements, and make all regulations for automobile builders and designers. CDOT is the newest Class Services branch, and would appreciate anyone who would like to help develop it.

<p>
If you are a CDOT officer, there will be a page to access your officer portal soon. However, it is not available yet. You will be contacted when it is released.
